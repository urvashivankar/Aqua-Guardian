# AQUA Guardian - Deployment Configuration

## Important: Update These URLs After Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Render
After deploying to Render, you will get a URL like:
`https://aqua-guardian-api.onrender.com`

### Step 2: Update Frontend Configuration
Edit this file and replace the placeholder URL:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
```

With your actual Render URL:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://aqua-guardian-api.onrender.com
```

### Step 3: Update Backend CORS
In Render dashboard, set the ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable to your Vercel URL:

```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
```

### Step 4: Redeploy
After updating these files, commit and push to trigger redeployment:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update deployment URLs"
git push origin main
```
